# TKS - Deploy Kubernetes Apps

This repository can be used on its own but it is intended to be used as a submodule of [TKS](https://github.com/zimmertr/TKS). TKS enables enthusiasts and administrators alike to easily provision highly available and production-ready Kubernetes clusters and other modern infrastructure on Proxmox VE.

## Summary

`Deploy Kubernetes Apps` is a collection of Kubernetes manifests, Kustomizations, and Ansible roles used to deploy applications to Kubernetes.

<hr>

## Requirements

This project assumes you have a working [Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/zimmertr/TKS-Bootstrap_Kubernetes).
<hr>

## Instructions

When possible, an application is expressed with Kustomize and contains an example overlay from my environment. Simply create a new overlay from this example and deploy it.

```bash
kubectl apply -k APP/overlays/example
```

Sometimes it is necessary to use the Kustomize binary instead of `kubectl -k` to build manifests. In a situation where `kubectl -k` throws an error, try instead:

```bash
kustomize build APP/overlays/example | kubectl apply -f-
```

In some cases, an application requires more than just Kustomize to be deployed. For example, OpenEBS requires that you install an iSCSI driver on your worker nodes. In these cases, an Ansible role and additional instructions are provided.

In all cases, a supplemental README is provided with further details about configuring & deploying the application. Consult the table below for links and more information.
