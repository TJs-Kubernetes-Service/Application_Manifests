TooDo Dockerfile
    - Added ENV for control over database configuration:
        - ENV DATABASE_URL=postgres://toodo:toodo@postgres:5432/toodo_production?sslmode=disable
    - Removed problematic RUN command: RUN dep ensure -v

Built Ansible project to deploy Harbor
    - Secured Harbor with Lets Encrypt SSL

Built Kustomize project to deploy Toodo
    - Secret & configmap generators from file when appropriate
        - Formatting requires kustomize binary, kubectl kustomize support too old
    - Added postgres-wait init container so Toodo doesn't start up too early
    - Added job to set up database schema
        - Enabling it in Dockerfile is problematic since it will run every time app starts
        - Job is problematic in Kustomize due to immutability
            - Future refactor by deploying Kustomize app in tiers?
    - Supports horizontal scaling
    - Docker registry secret is used for private registry
        - Can't use secretGenerator due to limitation with Kustomize?
    - Postgres data is persistent via dynamic NFS PV
        - Deployed by a statefulset
    - Integrated with Istio
