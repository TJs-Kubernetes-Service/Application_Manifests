Kubernetes
    - Either node-exporter or kube-state-metrics appear to not be collecting all necessary metrics for Grafana

InfluxDB-telegraf
    - Sputnik & Explorer are not sending all of their metrics. CPU is missing, for example

Provision.yml
    - Created Datasources are not immutable. Consider migrating api calls to datasources directory on grafana pod like dashboards.
    - Ensure order of resources makes sense

delete.yml
    - Ensure order of resources makes sense

vars.yml
    - There are way too many variables in vars.yml. How can telegraf stuff be abstracted away?
    - File needs to be reorganized

Other:
    - Ensure lastpass secrets are all up to date
    - Ensure all resource names in Kubernetes are properly defined with prefixes
    - Ensure that all Telegraf instances are not sending any error messages
    - Remove name_suffixes from Telegraf metrics when unnecessary
    - Evaluate complexity of making repo immutable for other users & refactor as necessary
    - Integrate Ingress controller to minimize number of LB Services
    - Rotate all passwords since probably exposed on Git repo
    - Configure telegraf on Jupiter
    - Evaluate Log Monitoring stuff
